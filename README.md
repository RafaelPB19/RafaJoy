# RafaJoy âš¡
A modified UnoJoy version for my Arduino Gamepad.

# Changes:
- Deleted some input's read and analog's read for more stability.
- This version uses only 1 joystick and 7 digital buttons.
- In this version the baud rate is 250,000. In UnoJoy official documentation explain that it's a best value, but it's not supported on Macs.
